# Tarot-Reading-App

This is a project that uses a dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lsind18/tarot-json


The main purpose of this project is to use the streamlit library to develop a web app.

Additionally, there are two notebooks from i) google colab and ii) kaggle. Each notebook has its own purpose.
